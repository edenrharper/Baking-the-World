<h2>Ingreditents</h2>
<h3>Peanut Butter Cookies</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1/2 cup (108g) unsalted butter, room temp</li>
    <li>2/3 cup (175g) creamy peanut butter</li>
    <l>3/4 cup (155g) light brown sugar</l>
    <li>3 tbsp (57g) honey</li>
    <li>1 large egg</li>
    <li>1 1/2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
    <li>3/4 tsp baking soda</li>
    <li>1/4 tsp kosher salt</li>
    <li>2 tsp cornstarch</li>
    <li>1 1/3 cup (175g) all-purpose flour</li>
</ul>
`
<ul>
    <li>3 tbsp granulated sugar</li>
    <li>3 tbsp sparkling sugar (or more granulated sugar)</li>
    <li>3 tbsp rainbow sprinkles</li>
    <li>1/4 cup dry roasted salted peanuts, uniform finely chopped</li>
</ul>


<h2>Instructions</h2>
<h3>Peanut Butter Cookies</h3>
<ol>
    <li>In a large mixing bowl using a hand or stand mixer with the paddle attachment, mix the butter and peanut butter until smooth.</li>
    <li>Add the brown sugar and mix again until smooth.
    <li>Mix in the honey, egg, and vanilla extract.
    <li>Then mix in the baking soda, salt, and cornstarch until well incorporated.</li>
    <li>Last, mix in the flour. Switch to a rubber spatula and mix by hand to ensure itâ€™s fully mixed in. </li>
    <li>Cover the bowl and chill for at least 30 minutes. *30 minutes will provide a cookie that looks like the photos here, but chill for a couple hours and the cookie will bake a bit thicker. You can also chill the dough overnight. To do so, chill the dough for 30 minutes then roll and coat the balls, cover, and chill.</li>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 350F and line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
    <li>In a small dish, mix together the peanut sprinkles. Feel free to add more sprinkles or peanuts for a hefty coating.</li>
    <li>Using a large cookie scoop (3 tbsp worth), scoop the dough and roll in the coating. The dough should be soft and a tiny bit sticky.</li>
    <li>Place 4 cookies on the baking pan and bake for 12-14 minutes or until the edges are golden and the center looks pale, puffed, and slightly underdone.</li>
    <li>Immediately after pulling the cookies from the oven, use the inside curve of a fork to nudge in the sizes to create uniform cookies.</li>
    <li>Let the cookies rest on the pan for a couple minutes, then transfer to a cooling rack and continue baking the batch.</li>
    <li>The cookies are best at room temperature. Enjoy!</li>
